### Day 5: June 3, 2021
Today I decided to start a new version of the log. This to separate this run from the previous 2 runs. Next to that I decided to invert the logging, this way I will just add to the top of the log which makes it easier to edit the log each day.

**Today's Progress**:
Today I did read more tutorials on F# while experimenting implementing these tutorials.

**Link(s) to work**:
1. [Some F# test code](https://github.com/visschersm/fsharp-learn)
2. [F# tutorials](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/introduction-to-functional-programming/first-class-functions)

### Day 4: June 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continuing to getting a good grasp on the F# language. I notice that I find it harder to find good tutorials, maybe I will go shopping for some nice books. My goal is that I am able to build some basic projects from scratch with some decent confidence.

### Day 3: June 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued working on following the tutorial on building my own query language. I will put the link in the links to work section. I noticed that when following the tutorial I can understand what is happening, but I do not yet have a good grasp on the language itself.

### Day 2: May 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**: A day longer already then Take 2! Lets keep going. Spent some more time with FSharp. Currently following along with a talk about building your own Query language with FParsec. Had some issues with the target framework, since I already had the dotnet 6 sdk installed. The issues were limited to unresolved dependencies which would still be resolved when using the dotnet cli.

### DAY 1: May 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Take 3! In spirit of 3 times is the charm, let's continue this run. Some turbulent times at work which should not have kept me from this amazing challenge. Today I have spent my first hour or two in FSharp. It looks like an interesting language which is built on the framework that I know and love aka dotnet. In the future I want to extend my functional knowledge to Haskell aswell since I have heard that that is the functional language mostly used.

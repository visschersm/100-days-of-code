### Day 30: June 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Yesterday I skipped a day since I was away for a training. Today however I spent some time on learning some more F# and Haskell. For F# I spent some time working on getting a better grasp on recursion. I watch some tutorial again about recursion since I was stuck a bit but my knowledge is increasing bit by bit.

### Day 29: June 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Today I worked some more on the MatrTech project. Extending the testcases next to building and running them for the three active frameworks (netcore 3.1, net 5 and net 6). First time I could not makeout why we currently do not have a 100% test coverage on 1 specific method.

### Day 28: June 27, 2021

** Today's Progress**:
After the Haskell examples I was wondering if I could do these in F#. It was a bit of a struggle but I managed to get some math functions up and running.

### Day 27: June 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Today I continued the Haskell course on Pluralsight. It took me a while to get some extensions in VSCode up and running but now I am okay with the setup I have running. After setting up I started with some examples to understand the syntax better.

### Day 25: June 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Today I spent a day working on the MatrTech project. Finally all the packages we have been working on are on nuget. Had some troubles getting the version in a manner that we liked. Now we have our own local timebased build versions of the packages next to a specific release version and it is all building using github actions!

### Days 22 - 24: June 21 - June 23, 2021

**Progress**:
The last couple of days I have been struggling getting our packaged deployed to nuget. Each day I have been trying to get it done in another way. Biggest point I have been struggling with is using two different version mechanizems. I wanted to have 1 specific local version which dynamically was updated when building and I wanted to have a release version on nuget. Today I finally got it to work. When using the <Version> attribute in the C# project and overriding this when building and releasing the package.
  
Next to that I have been continuing following pluralsight courses but forgot to take one yesterday. Sadly my 13day streak has come to an end. But I will just start over and continue to learn some more F# and expand my C# knowledge.

### Day 21: June 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Today I restructured most of the MatrTech projects. Adding some github workflows and giving them an automatic build version.

### Day 20: June 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Quite a busy day so I only spend some time on plural sight extending my F# and C# knowledge. I am currently thinking to do a project which includes both while sharing the dotnet framework.
I was thinking of a program/vscode extension that can run http requests while using shared requests to easily quick check your api's.

### Day 19: June 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Today I followed along with a C# pluralsight course since I want to improve my skill ranking a bit further.

### Day 18: June 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Today I managed to put some time in my cooperative project. I am planning to setup some projects that include some usefull libraries for multiple purposes. From testing to extensions all automatically deployed while using github actions. Next to that I spent some time on the pluralsight F# course and finished the composer parser.

### Day 17: June 16, 2021 

**Today's Progress**:
Today I did the skill test on plural sight for the skills Entity Framework and Python. As expected my knowledge of Python is not yet at a level to call myself an expert. Sadly there was no path/skill check on the F# course.

### Day 16: June 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Since my start of the F# pluralsight course I have been trying out and struggling with some code examples. Today I finally finished up a basic pythagoras function. I challenged myself to use 2 different functions to get the pieces done. After that I continued the course and learned about records, tuples, lists and arrays. Adding that to the code samples to tryout some more examples.

### Day 15: June 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Yesterday I forgot to add the log so I combined the dates. I have been continuing the course on F# which I just completed the second course. 
In this course I have built a sound generator. When trying out some more code for myself I had some trouble understanding how to combine functions. Will look into that tomorrow some more.

### Day 14 & Day 15: June 12 & 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Today I continued the course on F#. Trying out this (for me) new language. I am not really comfertable with the syntax but maybe that will come soon.

### Day 13: June 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

### Day 10, 11 & 12: June 8 - 10 2021

**Today's Progress**:
I've been working on and off the last couple of days on my GenericFactory. Learning about how Autofac closes the DI for saftey. I, however, wanted to open it up so that I can easily use what is in the DI while running tests. In the end I found a way by rebuilding the container each time the state changes and with a little reflection managed to provide decent DI for testing purposes.

### Day 9: June 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Today I spent some time on learning about the project vs repository structure in github. Next to that I have been optimizing my terminal in vscode. I installed poshgit to provide auto complete on git commands.
Next to that I have been adding action support to the test utility package.

### Day 8: June 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Today I spent some time on figuring out how to built against multiple sdks using github actions. In the end I learned that building with multiple sdks does not provide more support. It will be useful though when another sdk is release to see if the project still builts. For multiple sdk support I can just use TargetFramework(s) in dotnet.

### Day 7: June 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Today I worked some more on the side project. Now extending the unit test package with some extension methods that I like to use. And some new ones that I want to start using to make testing easier when using MongoDb. Also I managed to make the first actions work, updating a nuget package.

### Day 6: June 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Today I started working on a side project that has been in my head for quite some time. This side project contains some useful package(s) for c# unit/integration testing. Next to that I want to use github actions to build and test the package(s). The actions should automatically be run when updating the main branch to check if the project is still valid and update the package when it is valid.

### Day 5: June 3, 2021
Today I decided to start a new version of the log. This to separate this run from the previous 2 runs. Next to that I decided to invert the logging, this way I will just add to the top of the log which makes it easier to edit the log each day.

**Today's Progress**:
Today I did read more tutorials on F# while experimenting implementing these tutorials. Next to that I started working on a git project. This to learn more about git workflows, actions and projects.

3. [MPTest](https://github.com/visschersm/mptest)


### Day 4: June 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continuing to getting a good grasp on the F# language. I notice that I find it harder to find good tutorials, maybe I will go shopping for some nice books. My goal is that I am able to build some basic projects from scratch with some decent confidence.

**Link(s) to work**:
1. [Microsoft F# Tutorial page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/fsharp/)


### Day 3: June 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued working on following the tutorial on building my own query language. I will put the link in the links to work section. I noticed that when following the tutorial I can understand what is happening, but I do not yet have a good grasp on the language itself.

### Day 2: May 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**: A day longer already then Take 2! Lets keep going. Spent some more time with FSharp. Currently following along with a talk about building your own Query language with FParsec. Had some issues with the target framework, since I already had the dotnet 6 sdk installed. The issues were limited to unresolved dependencies which would still be resolved when using the dotnet cli.

### DAY 1: May 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Take 3! In spirit of 3 times is the charm, let's continue this run. Some turbulent times at work which should not have kept me from this amazing challenge. Today I have spent my first hour or two in FSharp. It looks like an interesting language which is built on the framework that I know and love aka dotnet. In the future I want to extend my functional knowledge to Haskell aswell since I have heard that that is the functional language mostly used.

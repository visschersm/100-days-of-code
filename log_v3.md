### Day 7: June 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Today I worked some more on the side project. Now extending the unit test package with some extension methods that I like to use. And some new ones that I want to start using to make testing easier when using MongoDb. Also I managed to make the first actions work, updating a nuget package.

### Day 6: June 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Today I started working on a side project that has been in my head for quite some time. This side project contains some useful package(s) for c# unit/integration testing. Next to that I want to use github actions to build and test the package(s). The actions should automatically be run when updating the main branch to check if the project is still valid and update the package when it is valid.

### Day 5: June 3, 2021
Today I decided to start a new version of the log. This to separate this run from the previous 2 runs. Next to that I decided to invert the logging, this way I will just add to the top of the log which makes it easier to edit the log each day.

**Today's Progress**:
Today I did read more tutorials on F# while experimenting implementing these tutorials. Next to that I started working on a git project. This to learn more about git workflows, actions and projects.

### Day 4: June 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continuing to getting a good grasp on the F# language. I notice that I find it harder to find good tutorials, maybe I will go shopping for some nice books. My goal is that I am able to build some basic projects from scratch with some decent confidence.

### Day 3: June 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued working on following the tutorial on building my own query language. I will put the link in the links to work section. I noticed that when following the tutorial I can understand what is happening, but I do not yet have a good grasp on the language itself.

### Day 2: May 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**: A day longer already then Take 2! Lets keep going. Spent some more time with FSharp. Currently following along with a talk about building your own Query language with FParsec. Had some issues with the target framework, since I already had the dotnet 6 sdk installed. The issues were limited to unresolved dependencies which would still be resolved when using the dotnet cli.

### DAY 1: May 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Take 3! In spirit of 3 times is the charm, let's continue this run. Some turbulent times at work which should not have kept me from this amazing challenge. Today I have spent my first hour or two in FSharp. It looks like an interesting language which is built on the framework that I know and love aka dotnet. In the future I want to extend my functional knowledge to Haskell aswell since I have heard that that is the functional language mostly used.

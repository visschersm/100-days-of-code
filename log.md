# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Januari 22 2021

Preparing for the 100-days-of-code challenge.
Before starting this challenge i'm gathering some possible research ideas.

**Today's Progress**: Started with a small C# DotNet 5.0 project in which I'm going to setup up a Dapper ORM connection. I created an Azure SQL Server to test with a real setup. But I'm struggling a bit because my SQL knowledge is really basic. Spend a bit more time than the hour on getting it to work, but the first data was written to the database.

### Day 1: Januari 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a dotnet webapi project with some libraries to tryout different ORMs. In the next few days I will work on an implementation on DAPPER ORM and comapre it with some EFCore implementation. Since EF is my mainly used ORM I will compare it with EF. I also want to create an implementation of LLBLGen since I heard of that last year and want to get familiar with that one as well.

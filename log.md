# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Januari 22 2021

Preparing for the 100-days-of-code challenge.
Before starting this challenge i'm gathering some possible research ideas.

**Today's Progress**: Started with a small C# DotNet 5.0 project in which I'm going to setup up a Dapper ORM connection. I created an Azure SQL Server to test with a real setup. But I'm struggling a bit because my SQL knowledge is really basic. Spend a bit more time than the hour on getting it to work, but the first data was written to the database.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
